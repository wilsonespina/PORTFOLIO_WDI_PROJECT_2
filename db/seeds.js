I usually go for the Katsu curry which is on par with every other Katsu curry I\'ve tried in the capital. It doesn\'t try to be something it\'s not - it\'s simple, tasty and filling. You are also provided complementary green tea and small corn snacks to eat whilst you wait for your mains (which can take a short while during busy times). The variety on the menu is good with different currys, dons, bento boxes, and sushi dishes on offer.',
